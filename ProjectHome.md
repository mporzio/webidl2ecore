# Introduction #
> WebIdl2Ecore aims at provide a text editor for writing webidl specification.  It uses [Xtext](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) as its foundation and provides nice editor features such as completion, template, validation, â€¦ Most notably, the webidl program written with WebIdl2Ecore are internally represented as an ecore model that conforms to the webidl specification. This allow the integration of any webidl specification with the [emf](http://www.eclipse.org/emf/) tooling, such as [ATL](http://www.eclipse.org/m2m/atl/) transformation and [Acceleo](http://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/) code generation.  Thus, two of the major milestone are a WebIdl2Java and WebIdl2Ecma ATL transformations, based on the Java binding and Ecma binding defined in the WebIdl Spec.

> WebIdl2Ecore is open-source, with an Eclipse Public license, as it is mainly an eclipse based project. Grammar and code source are available and open to reuse or modification.

> As  long as [W3C](http://www.w3c.org) specification of webIdl  is a work in progress,  webidl2ecore evolve to conforms to the specification.
